isomorphic serverless webrtc

## WIP!
This is a very early alpha-quality version!  Please do not use this in production, as it very likely won't work for you, let alone reliably.

This leverages a lot of the work that @cjb did on [serverless-webrtc](https://github.com/cjb/serverless-webrtc), particularly his adapter.
